# Motion Profile Generator
A simple tool to generate trapezoidal motion profiles. Supports profiles starting and ending at non-zero velocities, and profiles starting at a non-zero time.

Uses [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit tests and gnuplot for plotting. See this [blog post](https://www.eriksmistad.no/getting-started-with-google-test-on-ubuntu/) on how to install gtest.
